One major difference between nGQL and SQL is how subqueries are composed.

In SQL, subqueries are nested (embedded) to from a statement.
MeanWhile, nGQL use shell style PIPE (|).

### Examples

> GO FROM 201 OVER edge_serve | GO FROM $-.id OVER edge_fans | GO FROM $-.id ...

> GO FROM 100 OVER like YIELD like._dst AS Id, $$.player.name AS Name  | GO FROM $-.Id OVER like YIELD like._dst, like.likeness, $-.Name
