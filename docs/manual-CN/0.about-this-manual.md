## Typographical and syntax conventions

This manual uses certain typographical conventions:

- `Fixed width`

    A fixed-width font is used in syntax, code examples, system output, and file names.

- **Bold**

    Bold typeface indicates commands or characters the user types, provides emphasis, or the names of user interface elements.

- *Italic*

    Italic typeface indicates the title of a document, or signifies new terms.
    
- `UPPERCASE fixed width`

     Keywords in syntax and code examples are almost always shown in upper case. Although shown in uppercase, you can type keywords in either uppercase or lowercase.
