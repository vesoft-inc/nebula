## Contribute to documentation
Contributing to the Nebula documentation can be a rewarding experience. When you offer feedback, questions, edits, or new content, you help us, the projects you work on, and the larger Nebula community.

We welcome your participation to help make the documentation better!


## How to contribute to the docs
There are many wats to contribute:
 - Edit, rate, or file an issue or question directly on the site by using the links available on the right-side menu on every pare at docs.nebula.com.
 - File a documentation issue on GitHub at ***
 This is similar to clicking Request doc changes on a published docs page, but if you manually file an issue you need to fill in links to the related pages.
