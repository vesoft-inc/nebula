# Drop Edge Syntax

```
DROP EDGE edge_type_name
```

You must have the DROP privilege for the edge type.

This statement removes all the edges (connections) with the specific edge type.

All the files and directories in the disk are NOT deleted directly. They can only be released by future operations (see TODO).
