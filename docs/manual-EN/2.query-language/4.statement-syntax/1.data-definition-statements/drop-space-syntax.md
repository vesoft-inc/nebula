# Drop Space Syntax

```ngql
DROP SPACE space_name
```

You must have the DROP privilege for the graph space.

DROP SPACE deletes everything (all the vertices, edges, indices, and properties) in the specific space.  

Other spaces remain unchanged.

This statement does not immediately remove all the files and directories in the storage engine (and release disk space). The deletion depends on the implementation of different storage engines.

> Be *very* careful with this statement.
