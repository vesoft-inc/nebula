# Go Syntax

`GO` statement is the MOST commonly used clause in **Nebula Graph**.

It indicates to traverse in a graph with specific filters (the `WHERE` clause), to fetch properties of vertices and edges, and return results (the `YIELD` clause) with given order (the `ORDER BY ASC | DESC` clause) and numbers (the `LIMIT` clause).

> The syntax of `GO` statement is very similar to `SELECT` in SQL. Notice that the major difference is that `GO` must start traversing from a (set of) vertex (vertices).

```ngql
  GO [ <N> STEPS ] FROM <node_list>
  OVER <edge_type_list> [REVERSELY] [BIDIRECT]
  [ WHERE <expression> [ AND | OR expression ...]) ]
  YIELD | YIELDS [DISTINCT] <return_list>

<node_list>
   | <vid> [, <vid> ...]
   | $-.id

<edge_type_list>
   edge_type [, edge_type ...]
   * # `*` selects all the available edge types

<return_list>
    <col_name> [AS <col_alias>] [, <col_name> [AS <col_alias>] ...]
```

* [ \<N> STEPS ] specifies the N query hops
* <node_list> is either a list of node's vid separated by comma(,), or a special place holder `$-.id` (refer `PIPE` syntax).
* <edge_type_list> is a list of edge types which graph traversal can go through.
* [ WHERE \<expression> ] extracts only those results that fulfill the specified conditions. WHERE syntax can be conditions for src-vertex, the edges, and dst-vertex. The logical AND, OR, NOT are also supported. See [WHERE Syntax](where-syntax.md) for more information.
* YIELD [DISTINCT] <return_list> statement returns the result in column format and rename as an alias name. See `YIELD` syntax for more information. The `DISTINCT` syntax works the same as SQL.

## Examples

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 107 OVER serve;  \
   /* start from vertex 107 along with edge type serve, and get vertex 200, 201 */
==============
| serve._dst |
==============
| 200        |
--------------
| 201        |
--------------
```

```ngql
nebula> GO 2 STEPS FROM 103 OVER follow; \
  /* return the 2 hop friends of the vertex 103 */
===============
| follow._dst |
===============
| 101         |
---------------
```

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 109 OVER serve  \
   WHERE serve.start_year > 1990       /* check edge (serve) property ( start_year) */ \
   YIELD $$.team.name AS team_name, serve.start_year as start_year;   /* target vertex (team) property serve.start_year */
==========================
| team_name | start_year |
==========================
| Nuggets   | 2011       |
--------------------------
| Rockets   | 2017       |
--------------------------
```

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 100,102 OVER serve           \
        WHERE serve.start_year > 1995             /* check edge property */ \
        YIELD DISTINCT $$.team.name AS team_name, /* DISTINCT as SQL */ \
        serve.start_year as start_year,           /* edge property */ \
        $^.player.name AS player_name             /* source vertex (player) property */
==============================================
| team_name | start_year | player_name       |
==============================================
| Warriors  | 2001       | LaMarcus Aldridge |
----------------------------------------------
| Warriors  | 1997       | Tim Duncan        |
----------------------------------------------
```

### Traverse Along Multiple Edges Types

Currently, **Nebula Graph** also supports traversing via multiple edge types with `GO`. The syntax is:

```ngql
GO FROM <node_list> OVER <edge_type_list | *> YIELD | YIELDS [DISTINCT] <return_list>
```

For example:

```ngql
nebula> GO OVER FROM <node_list> edge1, edge2....  // traverse alone edge1 and edge2 or
nebula> GO OVER FROM <node_list> *   // * indicates traversing along all edge types
```

> Please note that when traversing along multiple edges, there are some special restrictions on the use of filters(namely the `WHERE` statement), for example filters like `WHERE edge1.prop1 > edge2.prop2` is not supported.

As for return results, if multiple edge properties are to be returned, **Nebula Graph** will place them in different rows. For example:

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 100 OVER follow, serve YIELD follow.degree, serve.start_year;

The following result is returned:

====================================
| follow.degree | serve.start_year |
====================================
| 0             | 1997             |
------------------------------------
| 95            | 0                |
------------------------------------
| 89            | 0                |
------------------------------------
| 90            | 0                |
------------------------------------

If there is no property, the default value will be placed. The default value for numeric type is 0, and for string type is an empty string, for bool is false, for timestamp is 0 (namely “1970-01-01 00:00:00”) and for double is 0.0.

Of course, you can query without specifying `YIELD`, which returns the vids of the dest vertices of each edge. Again, default values (here is 0) will be placed if there is no property. For example, query `GO FROM 100 OVER follow, serve;` returns the follow lines:

============================
| follow._dst | serve._dst |
============================
| 0           | 200        |
----------------------------
| 101         | 0          |
----------------------------
| 102         | 0          |
----------------------------
| 106         | 0          |
----------------------------
```

For query statement `GO FROM 100 OVER *`, the result is similar to the above example: the non-existing property or vid is populated with default values.
Please note that we can't tell which row belongs to which edge in the results. The future version will show the edge type in the result.

## Traverse Reversely

Currently, **Nebula Graph** supports traversing reversely using keyword `REVERSELY`. The syntax is:

```ngql
  GO FROM <node_list>
  OVER <edge_type_list> REVERSELY
  WHERE (expression [ AND | OR expression ...])  
  YIELD | YIELDS  [DISTINCT] <return_list>
```

For example:

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 100 OVER follow REVERSELY YIELD follow._src; -- returns 100
```

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 100 OVER follow REVERSELY YIELD follow._dst AS id | \
        GO FROM $-.id OVER serve WHERE $^.player.age > 20 YIELD $^.player.name AS FriendOf, $$.team.name AS Team;

============================
| FriendOf      | Team     |
============================
| Tony Parker   | Warriors |
----------------------------
| Kyle Anderson | Warriors |
----------------------------
```

The above query first traverses players that follow player 100 and finds the teams they serve, then filter players who are older than 20, and finally it returns their names and teams. Of course, you can query without specifying YIELD, which will return the vids of the dest vertices of each edge by default.

## Traverse Bidirect

Currently, **Nebula Graph** supports traversing along in and out edges using keyword `BIDIRECT`, the syntax is:

```ngql
  GO FROM <node_list>
  OVER <edge_type_list> BIDIRECT
  WHERE (expression [ AND | OR expression ...])  
  YIELD | YIELDS  [DISTINCT] <return_list>
```

For example:

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 102 OVER follow BIDIRECT;
===============
| follow._dst |
===============
| 101         |
---------------
| 103         |
---------------
| 135         |
---------------
```

The above query returns players followed by 102 and follow 102 at the same time.
