This chapter is for those who want to use `Nebula Graph` query language.

## Placeholder Identifiers and Values

The query language of **Nebula Graph**, i.e. the nGQL, refers to the following standards in design:

- ISO/IEC 10646
- ISO/IEC 39075
- ISO/IEC NP 39075 (Draft)

In template code, any token that is not a keyword, a literal value, or punctuation is a placeholder identifier or a placeholder value.

Tokens details please refer to the following table:

|  Token | Meaning  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| < >    | name of a syntactic element |
| ::=    | formula that defines an element |
| [ ]    | optional elements |
| { }    | explicitly specified elements |
|  \|    | complete alternative elements |
| ...    |  may be repeated any number of times |

Example:

```bash
INSERT VERTEX <tag_name> [, <tag_name>, ...] ( <prop_name_list>[, <prop_name_list> ...])
     {VALUES | VALUE} <vid>: ( <prop_value_list> [, <prop_value_list> ...])

prop_name_list:
  [prop_name [, prop_name] ...]

prop_value_list:
  [prop_value [, prop_value] ...]
```

The user-defined identifiers are tag_name, prop_name_list and prop_value_list.

- Choices

    The vertical bar `|` is used to separate the choices, when the syntax requires that the user choose one out of a set of values. Example:  Either the keyword TAG or EDGE is to be used.

    Template:

    ```bash
    ALTER TAG | EDGE <tag_name> | <edge_name>
    <alter_definition> [, alter_definition] ...]
    [ttl_definition [, ttl_definition] ... ]
    ```

- Optional content

    Square brackets are used to enclose a portion that is optional.  Options can be nested. Square brackets themselves are rarely used as part of the nGQL language itself.

    Example: In the CREATE SPACE statement, partition_num is optional. If used, partition_num is to be followed by a value.

    Sometimes, options are nested, which means that an inner option can only be used if the outer option is used:

    ```ngql
    CREATE SPACE [IF NOT EXISTS] <space_name>
    [(partition_num = <part_num>, replica_factor = <raft_copy>)]
    ```

    means that ASC or DESC may be used if and only if \<expression> is specified first.
