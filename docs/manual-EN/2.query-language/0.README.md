This chapter is for those who want to use `Nebula Graph` query language.

## Example Data

The example data used in **Nebula Graph** query statements can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula/blob/master/docs/manual-EN/2.query-language/example_data.zip). After downloading the example data, you can import it to your **Nebula Graph** database with [Nebula Graph Studio](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-web-docker).

## Placeholder Identifiers and Values

The query language of **Nebula Graph** is nGQL. Refer to the following standards in nGQL:

- ISO/IEC 10646
- ISO/IEC 39075
- ISO/IEC NP 39075 (Draft)

In template code, any token that is not a keyword, a literal value, or punctuation is a placeholder identifier or a placeholder value.

For details of the symbols in nGQL, refer to the following table:

|  Token | Meaning  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| < >    | name of a syntactic element |
| ::=    | formula that defines an element |
| [ ]    | optional elements |
| { }    | explicitly specified elements |
|  \|    | complete alternative elements |
| ...    |  may be repeated any number of times |
