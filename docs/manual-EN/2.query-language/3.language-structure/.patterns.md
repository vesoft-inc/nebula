# Patterns

Being effective with `nGQL` requires a good understanding of patterns. With patterns, you can describe the shape of data you are looking for. Patterns are case-sensitive.

For example, in the [LOOKUP](../4.statement-syntax/2.data-query-and-manipulation-statements/lookup-syntax.md) statement, you describe the data shape with pattern, then `nGQL` will find the data for you.  In this document, we will show you how to write pattern matching queries.

## Specifying Properties

Properties can be expressed in patterns. For example, the following query finds players whose names are _Tony Parker_.

```ngql
nebula > LOOKUP ON player WHERE player.name == "Tony Parker" \
YIELD person.name, person.age
```
