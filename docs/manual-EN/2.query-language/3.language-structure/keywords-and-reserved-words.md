# Keywords and Reserved Words

Keywords are words that have significance in nGQL. Certain keywords are reserved and require special treatment for use as identifiers.

Non-reserved keywords are permitted as identifiers without quoting. All the non-reserved keywords are automatically converted to lower case. Non-reserved keywords are non case-sensitive. Reserved words are permitted as identifiers if you quote them with single or double quotes such as \`AND\`.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG TAG(name string);
[ERROR (-7)]: SyntaxError: syntax error near `TAG'

nebula> CREATE TAG SPACE(name string); -- SPACE is an unreserved KEY WORD
Execution succeeded

nebula> SHOW TAGS; -- All the non-reserved keywords are automatically converted to lower case.
=============
| ID | Name |
=============
| 25 | space|
-------------
```

`TAG` is a reserved keyword and must be quoted with backtick to be used as an identifier. `SPACE` is keyword but not reserved, so its use as identifiers does not require quoting.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG `TAG` (name string); -- TAG is a reserved word here
Execution succeeded
```
