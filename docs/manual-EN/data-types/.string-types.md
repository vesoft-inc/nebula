# String Data Types

String is a dynamic length data type with no maximum length limit. Nebula supports the use of `'` and `"` to represent strings.

The string data types and introductions are as follows:

| Data Type | Description |

| CHAR(size) | A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter specifies the column length in characters - can be from 0 to 255.| 
| VARCHAR(size) | A VARIABLE length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter specifies the maximum column length in characters - can be from 0 to 65535 | 
| TINYTEXT | Holds a string with a maximum length of 255 characters |
| TEXT(size)	 | Holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytes | 
| BLOB(size) | For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 65,535 bytes of data | 
| MEDIUMTEXT | Holds a string with a maximum length of 16,777,215 characters | 
| MEDIUMBLOB | For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 16,777,215 bytes of data | 
| LONGTEXT | Holds a string with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 characters | 
| LONGBLOB | For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 4,294,967,295 bytes of data | 
| ENUM(val1, val2, val3, ...) | A string object that can have only one value, chosen from a list of possible values. You can list up to 65535 values in an ENUM list. If a value is inserted that is not in the list, a blank value will be inserted. The values are sorted in the order you enter them |
