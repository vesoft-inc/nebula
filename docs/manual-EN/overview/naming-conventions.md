# Naming Conventions
Vertices tags, edge types and properties are case sensitive, meaning for example that the property `name` means something different than the property `Name`. It is recommended to follow the naming conventions described in the following table:

| Graph entity  | Recommended style                                          | Example     |
|:-:            | :-:                                                        | :-:         |
|Key words      | Upper case                                                 | SHOW SPACES |
|Vertex tags    | Upper camel case, beginning with an upper-case character   | ManageTeam  |
|Edges          | Upper snake case, beginning with an upper-case character   | Play_for    |
|Property names | Lower camel case, beginning with a lower-case character    | inService   |
