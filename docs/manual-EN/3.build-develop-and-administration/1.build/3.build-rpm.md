# Build With rpm Packages

## Download and Install Package

Currently, **Nebula Graph** offers packages for `CentOS 7.5`, `CentOS 6.5`, `Ubuntu 1604` and `Ubuntu 1804`. You can download rpm or deb packages by clicking the [**Assets**](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula/releases).

For `CentOS` :

```bash
rpm -ivh nebula-{VERSION}.{SYSTEM_VERSION}.x86_64.rpm
```

For `Ubuntu` :

```bash
dpkg -i nebula-{VERSION}.{SYSTEM_VERSION}.amd64.deb
```

By default, the config files are under `/usr/local/nebula/etc`, you should modify the `meta_server_addrs` to set the Meta Server's address.

In order to enable multi copy Meta services, you should set the meta addresses split by comma into `meta_server_addrs`.

## Start Up Nebula Graph

Currently, we use `scripts/services.sh` to manage **Nebula Graph**.

You can `start`, `stop` and `restart` the services with this script.

Example command is as follows:

```bash
scripts/services.sh <start|stop|restart|status|kill>
```

## Connect Nebula Graph

```bash
> bin/nebula -u=user -p=password --addr={graphd IP address} --port={graphd listening port}
```

* -u is to set the user name, `user` is the default **Nebula Graph** user account
* -p is to set password, `password` is the default password for account `user`
* --addr is the graphd IP address
* --port is the the graphd server port and the default value is `3699`
