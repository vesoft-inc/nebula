# Build Source Code

## Prerequisite

Nebula is developed based C++14, so it requires a compiler supporting C++14 features.

### Supported system version

- Fedora 29, 30
- CentOS 6.5, 7.5
- Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04

### Disk and Memory Suggestion

When building type is **DEBUG**, an SSD disk with space more than **50GB** is suggested.

And **8GB** memory or more is required.

### Building locally

#### Step 1: clone code

```bash
bash> git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula.git
```

#### Step 2: install dependencies

The script `build_dep.sh` bellow depends on the cloud `Open-Storage-Service (OSS)`

##### A. If you can download `OSS` packages directly

```bash
 bash> cd nebula && ./build_dep.sh
```

##### B. If you cannot download `OSS` packages directly

1. Install others through local sources

```bash
bash> cd nebula && ./build_dep.sh N
```

2. Download the corresponding version of the dependency package

- [Fedora 29/30](https://nebula-graph.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/third-party/fedora29.tar.gz)
- [CentOS 7.0~7.6](https://nebula-graph.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/third-party/centos7.5.tar.gz)
- [CentOS 6.5](https://nebula-graph.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/third-party/centos6.5.tar.gz)
- [Ubuntu 1604](https://nebula-graph.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/third-party/ubuntu16.tar.gz)
- [Ubuntu 1804](https://nebula-graph.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/third-party/ubuntu18.tar.gz)

3. Install the package

```text
tar xf ${package_name}.tar.gz
cd ${package_name} && ./install.sh
```

#### Step 3: update **~/.bashrc**

```bash
bash> source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Step 4: build debug version

```bash
bash> mkdir build && cd build
bash> cmake ..
bash> make
bash> sudo make install
```

#### Build release version, regenerate the makefile

```bash
bash> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
bash> make
bash> sudo make install
```

#### **Building completed**

- If no errors are shown

    ```bash
    [100%] Built target ....
    ```

    **Congratulations! Compile successfully...**

- You can see there are four folders in the the installation directory **/usr/local/nebula**: **etc/**, **bin/**, **scripts/**, **share/**.

    ```bash
    [root@centos7.5 nebula]# ls /usr/local/nebula/
    bin  etc  scripts  share
    ```

**Now, you can start nebula!**

## Trouble Shooting

### Error info: `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find Scrt1.o: No such file or directory`

1. Modify **~/.bashrc** by appending following line to the end

```bash
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LIBRARY_PATH
```

2. Update **~/.bashrc**

```bash
bash> source ~/.bashrc
```

### Error info: `[ERROR] No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?`

1. do `java -version` get your java jdk version
1. if your java version is not `1.8.0_xxx`, please install it

#### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-8-jdk
```

#### Centos

```bash
sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk
```

#### switch java

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

and select the `java-1.8.0-openjdk/java-8-openjdk`

### Error info: `internal error`

You need to compile the third-party by yourself, the installation path is **/opt/nebula/third-party**

Step 1: Download third-party src package

```bash
bash> wget https://nebula-graph.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/third-party/nebula-3rdparty.tar.gz
```

Step 2: Build third-party

```bash
bash> tar xf nebula-3rdparty.tar.gz && cd nebula-3rdparty
bash> ./install_deps.sh
bash> cmake ./
bash> sudo make
```

Step 3: Configure the project's environment variables and download other dependencies

```bash
bash> cd nebula && ./build_dep.sh N
bash> source ~/.bashrc
bash> mkdir build && cd build
bash> cmake ..
bash> make
```
