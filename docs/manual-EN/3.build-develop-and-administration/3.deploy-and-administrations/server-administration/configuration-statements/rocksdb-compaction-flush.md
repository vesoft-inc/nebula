Nebula supports auto and manual (through HTTP request) RocksDB compaction or flush in storage service.

## Auto RocksDB Compaction

```bash
UPDATE CONFIGS storage:rocksdb_column_family_options = { disable_auto_compactions = true }
```

### Turn on auto Compaction

```bash
UPDATE CONFIGS storage:rocksdb_column_family_options = { disable_auto_compactions = false }
```

## Manually Trigger compaction and flush

Use the following command to trigger compaction and flush manually through HTTP request.

```bash
curl "${ws_ip}:${ws_http_port}/admin?space=${spaceName}&${op}"
```

- `ws_ip` is the HTTP service IP, which can be found in config file `etc/storage.conf`
- `ws_port` is the storage HTTP port
- `op` is the associated admin operations, only `compact` and `flush` are supported currently

For example:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:12000/admin?space=test&op=compact"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:12000/admin?space=test&op=flush"
```

> Notice that you should create space test before the above curl command.
