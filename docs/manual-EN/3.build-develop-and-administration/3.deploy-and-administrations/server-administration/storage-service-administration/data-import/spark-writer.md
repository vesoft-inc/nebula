# Spark Writer

## Overview

Spark Writer is Nebula Graph's Spark-based distributed data import tool that converts data from multiple data repositories into vertices and edges of graphs and batch imports data into the graph database. Currently supported data repositories are:

* HDFS, including Parquet, JSON, ORC and CSV
* HIVE

Spark Writer supports concurrent importing multiple tags and edges, and configuring different data repositories on different tags and edges.

## Prerequisites

```

## User Guide

This section includes the following steps:

1. Create a graph space and its schema in Nebula Graph
2. Write data files
3. Write input source mapping file
4. Import data

### Create Graph Space

Please refer to the example graph in [Quick Start](../../../../../1.overview/2.quick-start/1.get-started.md).

Note: Please create a space and define the schema in Nebula Graph first, then use this tool to import data to Nebula Graph.

### Example Data

#### Vertices

A vertex data file consists of multiple rows, with each line in the file representing a point and its properties. In general, the first column is the ID of the vertex. This ID column is specified in the mapping file. Other columns are the properties of the vertex. Consider the following example in JSON format.

* **Player** data

```text
{"id":100,"name":"Tim Duncan","age":42}
{"id":101,"name":"Tony Parker","age":36}
{"id":102,"name":"LaMarcus Aldridge","age":33}
```

#### Edges

An edge data file consists of multiple rows, with each line in the file representing a point and its properties. In general, the first column is the ID of the source vertex, the second column is the ID of the dest vertex. These ID columns are specified in the mapping file. Other columns are the properties of the edge. Consider the following example in JSON format.

Take edge _**follow**_ as example:

* Edge without rank

```text
{"source":100,"target":101,"likeness":95}
{"source":101,"target":100,"likeness":95}
{"source":101,"target":102,"likeness":90}
```

* Edge with rank

```text
{"source":100,"target":101,"likeness":95,"ranking":2}
{"source":101,"target":100,"likeness":95,"ranking":1}
{"source":101,"target":102,"likeness":90,"ranking":3}
```

#### Spatial Data Geo

Spark Writer supports importing Geo data. Geo data contains **latitude** and **longitude**, and the data type is double.

```text
{"latitude":30.2822095,"longitude":120.0298785,"target":0,"dp_poi_name":"0"}
{"latitude":30.2813834,"longitude":120.0208692,"target":1,"dp_poi_name":"1"}
{"latitude":30.2807347,"longitude":120.0181162,"target":2,"dp_poi_name":"2"}
{"latitude":30.2812694,"longitude":120.0164896,"target":3,"dp_poi_name":"3"}
```

#### Data Source Files

The currently supported data sources by Spark Writer are:

* HDFS
* HIVE

##### HDFS Files

HDFS supports the following file formats:

* Parquet
* JSON
* CSV
* ORC

Player data in Parquet format:

```text
+-------+---+---------+
|age| id|        name|
+-------+---+---------+
| 42|100| Tim Duncan |
| 36|101| Tony Parker|
+-------+---+---------+
```

In JSON:

```json
{"id":100,"name":"Tim Duncan","age":42}
{"id":101,"name":"Tony Parker","age":36}
```

In CSV:

```csv
age,id,name
42,100,Tim Duncan
36,101,Tony Parker
```

##### Database

Spark Writer supports database as the data source, and only HIVE is available now.

Player format as follows:

|col_name |  data_type  | comment |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| id      |     int     |         |
| name    |     string  |         |
| age     |     int     |         |

### Write Configuration Files

The configuration files consist of Spark related information, Nebula Graph related information, and tags mapping and edges mapping blocks. Spark information is configured with the associated parameters running Spark. Nebula Graph information is configured with information such as user name and password to connect Nebula Graph. Tags mapping and edges mapping correspond to the input source mapping of multiple tag/edges respectively, describing the basic information like each tag/edge's data source. It's possible that different tag/edge come from different data sources.

Example of a mapping file for the input source:

```text
{
  # Spark related configurations.
  # See also: http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html
  spark: {
    app: {
      name: Spark Writer
    }

    driver: {
      cores: 1
      maxResultSize: 1G
    }

    cores {
      max: 16
    }
  }

  # Nebula Graph related configurations.
  nebula: {
    # Query engine address list.
    addresses: ["127.0.0.1:3699"]

    # Nebula Graph access user name and password.
    user: user
    pswd: password

    # Nebula Graph space's name.
    space: test

    # The thrift connection timeout and retry times.
    # If no configurations are set, the default values are 3000 and 3 respectively.
    connection {
      timeout: 3000
      retry: 3
    }

  # The nGQL execution retry times.
  # If no configuration is set, the default value is 3.
    execution {
      retry: 3
    }
  }

  # Processing tags
  tags: [

    # Loading tag from HDFS and the data type is parquet.
    # The tag's name is tag_name_0.
    # field_0, field_1 and field_2 from HDFS's Parquet file are written into tag_name_0
    # and the vertex column is vertex_key_field.
    {
      name: tag_name_0
      type: parquet
      path: hdfs_path
      fields: {
        field_0: nebula_field_0,
        field_1: nebula_field_1,
        field_2: nebula_field_2
      }
      vertex: vertex_key_field
      batch : 16
    }

    # Similar to the above.
    # Loading from Hive will execute command ${exec} as data set.
    {
      name: tag_name_1
      type: hive
      exec: "select hive_field_0, hive_field_1, hive_field_2 from database.table"
      fields: {
        hive_field_0: nebula_field_0,
        hive_field_1: nebula_field_1,
        hive_field_2: nebula_field_2
      }
      vertex: vertex_id_field
    }
  ]

  # Processing edges
  edges: [
    # Loading edge from HDFS and data type is JSON.
    # The edge's name is edge_name_0.
    # field_0, field_1 and field_2 from HDFS's JSON file are written into edge_name_0
    # The source column is source_field, target column is target_field and ranking column is ranking_field.
    {
      name: edge_name_0
      type: json
      path: hdfs_path
      fields: {
        field_0: nebula_field_0,
        field_1: nebula_field_1,
        field_2: nebula_field_2
      }
      source:  source_field
      target:  target_field
      ranking: ranking_field
    }

    # Loading from Hive will execute command ${exec} as data set.
    # Ranking is optional.
    {
      name: edge_name_1
      type: hive
      exec: "select hive_field_0, hive_field_1, hive_field_2 from database.table"
      fields: {
        hive_field_0: nebula_field_0,
        hive_field_1: nebula_field_1,
        hive_field_2: nebula_field_2
      }
      source:  source_id_field
      target:  target_id_field
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Mapping of Tags and Edges

The options for tag and edge mapping are very similar. The following describes the same options first, and then introduces the unique options of `tag mapping` and `edge mapping`.

* **Same Options**
  * `type` is a case insensitive required field that specifies data type in the context, and currently supports Parquet, JSON, ORC and CSV
  * `path` is applied to HDFS data source and specifies the absolute path of HDFS file or directory. It is a required field when the type is HDFS
  * `exec` is applied to Hive data source. It is a required filed when the query type is HIVE
  * `fields` is a required filed that maps the columns of the data source to properties of tag / edge

* **unique options for tag mapping**
  * `vertex` is a required field that specifies a column as the vertex ID column
* **unique options for edge mapping**
  * `source` is a required field that specifies a column in the input source as the **source vertex** ID column
  * `target` is a required field that specifies a column as the **dest vertex** ID column
  * `ranking` is an optional field that specifies a column as the edge ranking column when the inserted edge has a ranking value

#### Data Source Mapping

* **HDFS Parquet Files**
  * `type` specifies the input source type. When it is parquet, it is a case insensitive required field
  * `path` specifies the HDFS file directory. It is a required field that must be the absolute directory
