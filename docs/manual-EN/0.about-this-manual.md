This manual uses certain typographical conventions:

- `Fixed width`

    A fixed-width font is used for `ngql statements`, `code examples`, `system output`, and `file names`.

- **Bold**

    Bold typeface indicates **commands**, **user types**, or **interface**.

    `REVERSED KEYWORDS` and `NON REVERSED KEYWORDS` in query-language and code examples are almost always shown in upper case.
