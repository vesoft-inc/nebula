# Quick Start

## Try Nebula Graph From Docker

The easiest way to get **Nebula Graph** up and running is using Docker. Before you start, make sure that you have:

* Installed the latest version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

* Pulled the latest images of Nebula from [Nebula Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vesoft/nebula-graph). If not, pull the images using the following command:

```bash
> docker pull vesoft/nebula-graph:nightly
```

## Hardware Requirement (Suggestion)

An `SSD` disk is required with at least **50GB** space available.
And memory should be more than **8GB**.

The service might crash without enough memory/disk.

## Try Nebula Graph Deployment From Docker Compose

The easiest way to try nebula cluster is using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). For details please refer nebula [docker deployment](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-docker-compose).

### Startup Service

When `nebula` image is ready, run a container:

```bash
> docker run -it vesoft/nebula-graph:nightly /bin/bash
```

After login, you're in the `root` directory and you should switch to the nebula directory

```bash
> cd /usr/local/nebula/
```

Start meta service, storage service and graph service:

```bash
> scripts/nebula.service start all
```

Check services' status:

```bash
> scripts/nebula.service status all
```

### Connect to Service

```bash
> bin/nebula -u=user -p=password
```

* -u is to set the user name, `user` is the default Nebula user account
* -p is to set password, `password` is the default password for account `user`

Further more, if you run the console (`bin/nebula`) in a remote host from `graphd`, please specify the server's ip and port:

```bash
> bin/nebula -u=user -p=password -addr={graphd ip} --port={graphd port}
```

If you have any questions or concerns about the deployment procedures, please do not hesitate to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula/issues).

## Build Your Own Graph

This section describes how to build a graph and run queries. The example is built on the graph below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42762957/68355084-24cee280-0149-11ea-8e16-79e6d4af8638.png)

There are three kinds of tags (_course_, _building_ and _student_) and two edge types (_choose_ and _follow_).

### Create a Graph Space

First, we need to create a space and use it before other operations.

To list all existing spaces:

```ngql
nebula> SHOW SPACES;
```

To create a new space named `test`:

```ngql
nebula> CREATE SPACE test(partition_num=100, replica_factor=1);
-- Use this space
nebula> USE test;
```

* `replica_factor` specifies the number of replicas in the cluster.
* `partition_num` specifies the number of partitions in one replica.

### Define Graph Schema

The `CREATE TAG` statement defines a tag, with a type name and an attribute list.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG course (name string, credits int);
nebula> CREATE TAG building (name string);
nebula> CREATE TAG student (name string, age int, gender string);
```

The `CREATE EDGE` statement defines an edge type.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE EDGE follow(likeness double);
nebula> CREATE EDGE choose(grade int);
```

To list the tags and edge types that we just createdï¼š

```ngql
-- Show tag list
nebula> SHOW TAGS;
============
| Name     |
============
| building |
------------
| course   |
------------
| student  |
------------
-- Show edge type list
nebula> SHOW EDGES;
==========
| Name   |
==========
| choose |
----------
| follow |
----------
```

To show the attributes of a tag or an edge type:

```ngql
-- Show attributes of a tag
nebula> DESCRIBE TAG student;
===================
| Field  | Type   |
===================
| name   | string |
-------------------
| age    | int    |
-------------------
| gender | string |
-------------------
-- Show attributes of an edge type
nebula> DESCRIBE EDGE follow;
=====================
| Field    | Type   |
=====================
| likeness | double |
---------------------
```

### Insert Data

Insert the vertices and edges based on the graph above.

```ngql
-- Insert vertices
nebula> INSERT VERTEX student(name, age, gender) VALUES 200:("Monica", 16, "female");
nebula> INSERT VERTEX student(name, age, gender) VALUES 201:("Mike", 18, "male");
nebula> INSERT VERTEX student(name, age, gender) VALUES 202:("Jane", 17, "female");
nebula> INSERT VERTEX course(name, credits),building(name) VALUES 101:("Math", 3, "No5");
nebula> INSERT VERTEX course(name, credits),building(name) VALUES 102:("English", 6, "No11");

-- Insert edges
nebula> INSERT EDGE choose(grade) VALUES 200 -> 101:(5);
nebula> INSERT EDGE choose(grade) VALUES 200 -> 102:(3);
nebula> INSERT EDGE choose(grade) VALUES 201 -> 102:(3);
nebula> INSERT EDGE choose(grade) VALUES 202 -> 102:(3);
nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(likeness) VALUES 200 -> 201:(92.5);
nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(likeness) VALUES 201 -> 200:(85.6);
nebula> INSERT EDGE follow(likeness) VALUES 201 -> 202:(93.2);
```

### Update Data

```ngql
-- Update vertex
nebula> UPDATE VERTEX 101 SET course.credits = $^.course.credits + 1, building.name = "No8" YIELD $^.course.name AS Name, $^.course.credits AS Credits, $^.building.name
-- Update edge
nebula> UPDATE EDGE 200 -> 101 OF choose SET grade = choose.grade +1
```

### Fetch Data

Fetch the data updated.

```ngql
nebula> FETCH PROP ON course 101;
================================
| course.name | course.credits |
================================
| Math        | 4              |
--------------------------------
nebula> FETCH PROP ON choose 200 -> 101
================
| choose.grade |
================
| 6            |
----------------
```

### Delete Data

Delete vertex.

```ngql
nebula> DELETE VERTEX $vid
```

### Sample Queries

Q1. Find the vertexes that 201 follows:

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 201 OVER follow;
=============
| follow._dst |
=============
| 200       |
-------------
| 202       |
-------------
```

Q2. Find the vertexes that 201 follows, whose ages are greater than 17.
Return their name, age and gender, and alias the columns as Friend, Age and Gender, respectively.

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 201 OVER follow WHERE $$.student.age >= 17 YIELD $$.student.name AS Friend, \
  $$.student.age AS Age, $$.student.gender AS Gender;
=========================
| Friend | Age | Gender |
=========================
|   Jane |  17 | female |
-------------------------
```

You can use backslash (`\`) as line break;

* `YIELD` specifies what values or results you might want to return from query.
* `$^` represents the source vertex.
* `$$` indicates the target vertex.

Q3. Find the chosen courses and corresponding grades of students followed by 201.

```ngql
-- By pipe
nebula> GO FROM 201 OVER follow yield follow._dst as id \
  | GO FROM $-.id OVER choose YIELD $^.student.name AS Student,\
  $$.course.name AS Course, choose.grade AS Grade;
=============================
| Student |  Course | Grade |
=============================
|  Monica |    Math |     6 |
-----------------------------
|  Monica | English |     3 |
-----------------------------
|    Jane | English |     3 |
-----------------------------

-- By temporary variable
nebula> $var=GO FROM 201 OVER follow yield follow._dst as id; \
  GO FROM $var.id OVER choose YIELD $^.student.name AS Student,\
  $$.course.name AS Course, choose.grade AS Grade;
=============================
| Student |  Course | Grade |
=============================
|  Monica |    Math |     6 |
-----------------------------
|  Monica | English |     3 |
-----------------------------
|    Jane | English |     3 |
-----------------------------
```

* `|` denotes a pipe. The output of the formal query acts as input to the next one follow a pipeline.
* `$-` refers to the input stream.

The second approach adopts a user-defined variable `$var`. The scope of this variable is within the compound statement.

## Tips

In practice, it often takes several retries to find a proper graph schema during testing. You can put all the DDL statements in a file as follows.

```ngql
DROP SPACE test; -- Delete useless space
CREATE SPACE test(partition_num=100, replica_factor=1);
USE test;
CREATE TAG course(name string, credits int);
CREATE TAG building(name string);
CREATE TAG student(name string, age int, gender string);
CREATE EDGE like(likeness double);
CREATE EDGE select(grade int);
```

Then batch write to console

```bash
cat  schema.ngql | ./bin/nebula -u user -p password
```

Likewise, you can put hundreds or thousands DML statements in a data.ngql to insert. If you have millions of records to insert, please use the csv importer tool (or sst ingest tool).
