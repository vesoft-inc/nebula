# Quick Start

## Try Nebula Graph from Docker

The easiest way to get Nebula Graph up and running is using Docker. Before you start, make sure that you have:

* Installed the latest version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

* Pulled the latest images of Nebula from [Nebula Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vesoft/nebula-graph). If not, pull the images using the following command:

```sh
> docker pull vesoft/nebula-graph:nightly
```

### Startup Service

When `nebula` image is ready, run a container:

```sh
> docker run -it vesoft/nebula-graph:nightly /bin/bash
```

After login, you're in the `root` directory and you should switch to the nebula directory

```sh
> cd /usr/local/nebula/
```

Start meta service, storage service and graph service:

```sh
> scripts/nebula.service start all
```

Check services' status:

```sh
> scripts/nebula.service status all
```

### Connect to Service

```sh
> bin/nebula -u=user -p=password
```

* -u is to set the user name, `user` is the default Nebula user account
* -p is to set password, `password` is the default password for account `user`

Further more, if you run the console (`bin/nebula`) in a remote host from `graphd`, please specify the server's ip and port:

```sh
> bin/nebula -u=user -p=password -addr={graphd ip} --port={graphd port}
```

If you have any questions or concerns about the deployment procedures, please do not hesitate to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula/issues).

## Build Your Own Graph

This section describes how to build a graph and run queries. The example is built on the graph below:

![Untitled Diagram (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51590253/60649144-0774c980-9e74-11e9-86d6-bad1653e70ba.png)

There are three kinds of tags (_course_, _building_ and _student_) and two edge types (_select_ and _like_).

### Create a Graph Space

First, we need to create a space and use it before other operations.

To list all existing spaces:

```ngql
nebula> SHOW SPACES;
```

To create a new space named `myspace_test2`:

```ngql
nebula> CREATE SPACE myspace_test2 (partition_num=1024, replica_factor=1);
-- Use this space
nebula> USE myspace_test2;
```

* `replica_factor` specifies the number of replicas in the cluster.
* `partition_num` specifies the number of partitions in one replica.

### Define Graph Schema

The `CREATE TAG` statement defines a tag, with a type name and an attribute list.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE TAG course (name string, credits int);
nebula> CREATE TAG building (name string);
nebula> CREATE TAG student (name string, age int, gender string);
```

The `CREATE EDGE` statement defines an edge type.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE EDGE like(likeness double);
nebula> CREATE EDGE select(grade int);
```

To list the tags and edge types that we just createdï¼š

```ngql
-- Show tag list
nebula> SHOW TAGS;
-- Show edge type list
nebula> SHOW EDGES;
```

To show the attributes of a tag or an edge type:

```ngql
-- Show attributes of a tag
nebula> DESCRIBE TAG student;
-- Show attributes of an edge type
nebula> DESCRIBE EDGE like;
```

### Insert Data

Insert the vertices and edges based on the graph above.

```ngql
-- Insert vertices
nebula> INSERT VERTEX student(name, age, gender) VALUES 200:("Monica", 16, "female");
nebula> INSERT VERTEX student(name, age, gender) VALUES 201:("Mike", 18, "male");
nebula> INSERT VERTEX student(name, age, gender) VALUES 202:("Jane", 17, "female");
nebula> INSERT VERTEX course(name, credits),building(name) VALUES 101:("Math", 3, "No5");
nebula> INSERT VERTEX course(name, credits),building(name) VALUES 102:("English", 6, "No11");

-- Insert edges
nebula> INSERT EDGE select(grade) VALUES 200 -> 101:(5);
nebula> INSERT EDGE select(grade) VALUES 200 -> 102:(3);
nebula> INSERT EDGE select(grade) VALUES 201 -> 102:(3);
nebula> INSERT EDGE select(grade) VALUES 202 -> 102:(3);
nebula> INSERT EDGE like(likeness) VALUES 200 -> 201:(92.5);
nebula> INSERT EDGE like(likeness) VALUES 201 -> 200:(85.6);
nebula> INSERT EDGE like(likeness) VALUES 201 -> 202:(93.2);
```

### Sample Queries

Q1. Find the vertexes that 201 likes:

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 201 OVER like;
=============
| like._dst |
=============
| 200       |
-------------
| 202       |
-------------
```

Q2. Find the vertexes that 201 likes, whose ages are greater than 17.
Return their name, age and gender, and alias the columns as Friend, Age and Gender, respectively.

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 201 OVER like WHERE $$.student.age >= 17 YIELD $$.student.name AS Friend, \
  $$.student.age AS Age, $$.student.gender AS Gender;
=========================
| Friend | Age | Gender |
=========================
|   Jane |  17 | female |
-------------------------
```

You can use backslash (`\`) as line break;

* `YIELD` specifies what values or results you might want to return from query.
* `$^` represents the source vertex.
* `$$` indicates the target vertex.

Q3. Find the selected courses and corresponding grades of students liked by 201.

```ngql
-- By pipe
nebula> GO FROM 201 OVER like yield like._dst as id \
  | GO FROM $-.id OVER select YIELD $^.student.name AS Student,\
  $$.course.name AS Course, select.grade AS Grade;
=============================
| Student |  Course | Grade |
=============================
|  Monica |    Math |     5 |
-----------------------------
|  Monica | English |     3 |
-----------------------------
|    Jane | English |     3 |
-----------------------------

-- By temporary variable
nebula> $var=GO FROM 201 OVER like yield like._dst as id; \
  GO FROM $var.id OVER select YIELD $^.student.name AS Student,\
  $$.course.name AS Course, select.grade AS Grade;
=============================
| Student |  Course | Grade |
=============================
|  Monica |    Math |     5 |
-----------------------------
|  Monica | English |     3 |
-----------------------------
|    Jane | English |     3 |
-----------------------------
```

* `|` denotes a pipe. The output of the formal query acts as input to the next one like a pipeline.
* `$-` refers to the input stream.

The second approach adopts a user-defined variable `$var`. The scope of this variable is within the compound statement.
