# Trouble Shooting

## graphd config file doesn't register to meta server

   When starting nebula services with the `nebula.service` script, `graphd`, `metad` and `storaged` processes start too fast to make the graphd config file registered into the meta server. The same problem may also occur when restarting.

   If you are using the beta version, start the metad service first, then the storaged and graphd to avoid such problem. We will resolve this problem in the next release.

   Start metad first:

   ```sh
   nebula> scripts/nebula.service start metad
   [INFO] Starting nebula-metad...
   [INFO] Done
   ```

   Then start storaged and graphd

   ```sh
   nebula> scripts/nebula.service start storaged
   [INFO] Starting nebula-storaged...
   [INFO] Done

   nebula> scripts/nebula.service start graphd
   [INFO] Starting nebula-graphd...
   [INFO] Done
   ```

## Errors thrown when inserting data after tag or edge are created

This is likely caused by the default time interval (which is 120s) to fetch the meta data from the meta server. Change the value in parameter `load_data_interval_secs` to 1s.

- Change the values in nebula-metad.conf and nebula-graphd.conf before starting the services

   ```sh
   --load_data_interval_secs=1
   ```

- Run the following command in the console

   ```ngql
   nebula> UPDATE CONFIGS graph:load_data_interval_secs=1
   ```

## Errors thrown when executing command in docker

This is likely caused by the inconsistency between the docker IP and the default listening address (172.17.0.2). Thus we need to change the the latter one.

1. First run `ifconfig` in container to check your container IP, here we assume your IP is 172.17.0.3.
2. In directory `/usr/local/nebula/etc`, check the config locations of all the IP addresses with the command `grep "172.17.0.2" . -r`.
3. Change all the IPs you find in step 2 to your container IP 172.17.0.3.
4. Restart all the services.
