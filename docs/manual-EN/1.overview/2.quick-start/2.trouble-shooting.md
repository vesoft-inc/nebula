## graphd configuration doesn't register to meta server

When starting or restaring service with the `nebula.service` script, the processes of `graphd`, `metad` and `storaged` may be too fast to config graphd to the meta server.

To avoid such problem, users with beta version can run metad first, then run the storaged and graphd. We will fix this in the nest version.

First run metad:

```sh
   nebula> scripts/nebula.service start metad
   [INFO] Starting nebula-metad...
   [INFO] Done
```

Then run storaged and graphd:

```sh
   nebula> scripts/nebula.service start storaged
   [INFO] Starting nebula-storaged...
   [INFO] Done

   nebula> scripts/nebula.service start graphd
   [INFO] Starting nebula-graphd...
   [INFO] Done
```

## Error thrown when inserting data

When tags and edges are created, errors will occur during data inserting, that is because `load_data_interval_secs` sets a time interval (default value is 120s) to get meta data from the meta server. You can change the default value with the following method:

- Add the following value in nebula-storaged.conf and nebula-graphd.conf before starting the service

   ```sh
   --load_data_interval_secs=1
   ```

- Run the following command when starting the console

   ```SQL
   nebula> UPDATE VARIABLES graph:load_data_interval_secs=1
   ```

## Errors thrown when executing command with docker

Possible reason: docker IP is not the same with the default listening ip (172.17.0.2), thus you need to change it.

1. First run `ifconfig ` in the container to check your ip and we assume your ip is 172.17.0.3, which means you should change the default ip.
2. Swtich to config directory `cd /usr/local/nebula/etc` to check the location of all the IPs with `grep "172.17.0.2" . -r`.
3. Change IPs in the last step to your actual container ip, which is 172.17.0.3 here.
4. Restart all the services.
