## What does the time spent mean in the returns of each query

```ngql
nebula> GO FROM 101 OVER follow
===============
| follow._dst |
===============
| 100         |
---------------
| 102         |
---------------
| 125         |
---------------
Got 3 rows (Time spent: 7431/10406 us)
```

Taking the above query as an example, the first number is the time it takes the query engine to receive the data from the console and pass the data to the storage engine to perform a series of calculations on the entire link; the second number is the time spent from sending the request to receiving the response and outputting the results in the console.
