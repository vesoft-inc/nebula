# Graph Data Modeling

This guide helps you walk through the graph data modeling of Nebula Graph. We will introduce basic concepts of designing a graph data model.

## Graph Space

**Graph Space** is a physically isolated space for different graphs. It is similar to the database in MySQL.

## Directed Property Graph

The data model stored in **Nebula Graph** is a **_directed property graph_**, whose edges are directional and there could be properties on both edges and vertices. It can be represented as:
G = < V, E, P<sub>V</sub>, P<sub>E</sub> >,
where **V** is a set of nodes or vertices, **E** is a set of directional edges,
**P<sub>V</sub>** represents properties on vertices, and **P<sub>E</sub>** is the properties on edges.

We will use the example graph below to introduce the basic concepts of property graph:

In the preceding figure, we have a data set about the players and teams of NBA. We can see the eleven vertices are classified to two categories, i.e. **player** and **team** while the fifteen edges are classified to **_serve_** and **_like_**.

To better understand the elements of a graph data model, let us walk through each concept of the example graph.

## Vertices

Vertices are typically used to represent entities in the real world. In the preceding example, the graph contains eleven vertices.

## Tags

In **Nebula Graph**, we use **tags** to categorize vertex properties. In the example above, the vertices have tags **player** and **team**.

## Edge

Edges are used to connect vertices. Each edge usually represents a relationship or a behavior between two vertices. In the preceding example, edges are _**serve**_ and _**like**_.

## Edge Type

`Each edge` is an instance of an edge type. Our example uses _**serve**_ and _**like**_ as edge types. Take edge _**serve**_ for example, in the preceding figure, vertex `101` (represents a **player**) is the source vertex and vertex `215` (represents a **team**) is the target vertex. We see that vertex `101` has an outgoing edge while vertex `215` has an incoming edge.

## Properties

Properties are key-value pairs within vertices and edges. In our example graph, we used the properties `id`, `name` and `age` on **player**, `id` and `name` on **team**, and `likeness` on _**like**_ edge.

## Schema

In Nebula Graph, schema refers to the definition of properties (name, type, etc.). Like `MySQL`, Nebula Graph is a **strong typed** database. The name and data type of the properties should be determined before the data is written.
