# Docker Files for Nebula Graph Services

> **NOTE**: The `Dockerfile.graph` is used to build docker image only for **testing** in local machine since all of **Nebula Graph** services are installed in same image. This is not recommended practice for docker usage.

Following docker images will be ready in production.
