# - Try to find ncurses include dirs and libraries
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(NCURSES)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  NCURSES_ROOT_DIR          Set this variable to the root installation of
#                            ncurses if the module has problems finding the
#                            proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  NCURSES_FOUND             ncurses is found, include and lib dir
#  NCURSES_INCLUDE_DIR       The ncurses include directory
#  NCURSES_LIBRARY           The ncurses library
