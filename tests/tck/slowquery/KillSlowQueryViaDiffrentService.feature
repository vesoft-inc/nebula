Feature: Slow Query Test

  # There should be a least 2 thread to run this test case suite.
  Scenario: Set up slow query at first graph service
    # Set up a slow query which will be killed later.
    Given a graph with space named "nba"
    When executing query via graph 0:

  Scenario: Show all queries and kill all slow queries at second graph service
    When executing query via graph 1:

    Then the execution should be successful
