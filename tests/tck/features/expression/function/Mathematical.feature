Feature: Mathematical function Expression

  Scenario: bit functions
    When executing query:
      """
      return bit_and(5,bit_xor(4,bit_or(1,2))) as basic_test
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | basic_test |
      | 5          |
    When executing query:
      """
      return [bit_and(5,null),bit_or(5,null),bit_xor(5,null)] as null_test

    Then the result should be, in any order:

      | [NULL,NULL,NULL] |
    When executing query:
      """
      return [bit_and(5,true),bit_or(2,1.3),bit_xor("5",1)] as error_test
      """
    Then a SemanticError should be raised at runtime: Type error `bit_and(5,true)'
