Feature: Push Filter Down Cases Using the test Space

  Background:
    Given a graph with space named "ngdata"

  Scenario: push filter down hash join bug fix
    When profiling query:
      """
      MATCH (v1:Label_6:Label_3)<-[e2:Rel_1]-(:Label_5)-[e3]->(v2)
      WHERE (id(v1) in [20, 28, 31, 6, 4, 18, 15, 25, 9, 19, 21])
      MATCH p0 = (v2)<-[e4]-()-[e5]->(v3:Label_6)
      WITH min(v3.Label_6.Label_6_4_Int) AS pa0,
      v3.Label_6.Label_6_1_Bool AS pa2
      WHERE pa2
      RETURN pa2
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | pa2  |
      | true |
    And the execution plan should be:
