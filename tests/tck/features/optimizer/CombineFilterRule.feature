Feature: combine filters

  Background:
    Given a graph with space named "nba"

  Scenario: combine filters
    When profiling query:
      """
      MATCH (v:player)-[:like]->(n)
      WHERE v.age>40 AND n.age>42
      RETURN v, n
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | v                                                       | n                                                   |
      | ("Steve Nash" :player{age: 45, name: "Steve Nash"})     | ("Jason Kidd" :player{age: 45, name: "Jason Kidd"}) |
      | ("Vince Carter" :player{age: 42, name: "Vince Carter"}) | ("Jason Kidd" :player{age: 45, name: "Jason Kidd"}) |
      | ("Jason Kidd" :player{age: 45, name: "Jason Kidd"})     | ("Steve Nash" :player{age: 45, name: "Steve Nash"}) |
    And the execution plan should be:
      | id | name         | dependencies | operator info                                                                       |

      | 18 | Filter       | 13           | {"condition": "(($v.age>40) AND ($n.age>42) AND !(hasSameEdgeInPath($-.__COL_0)))"} |
