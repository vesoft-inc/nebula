Feature: Bug fixes on filter push-down

  Background:
    Given a graph with space named "ngdata"

  Scenario: missing predicate bug
    When profiling query:
      """
      MATCH (v0)<-[e0]-()<-[e1]-(v1)
      WHERE (id(v0) == 6)

    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | count(*) |
      | 0        |
