  Examples:

     | nba         |
     | nba_int_vid |

  Background:
    Given a graph with space named "<space_name>"

  Scenario: Elimintate Not Exists Tag
    When profiling query:
      """
      MATCH (v:player) WHERE v.not_exists_tag.name == 'Tim Duncan' RETURN v.player.age AS age
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | age |
    And the execution plan should be:
      | id | name    | dependencies | operator info |
      | 0  | Project | 1            |               |
      | 1  | Value   | 2            |               |
      | 2  | Start   |              |               |
