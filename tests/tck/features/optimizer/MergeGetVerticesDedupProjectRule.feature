Feature: merge get vertices, dedup and project rule

  Background:
    Given a graph with space named "nba"

  Scenario: apply get vert, dedup and project merge opt rule
    When profiling query:
      """
      MATCH (v)
      WHERE id(v) == 'Tim Duncan'
      RETURN v.player.name AS Name
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | Name         |
      | "Tim Duncan" |
    And the execution plan should be:
      | id | name        | dependencies | operator info     |
      | 9  | Project     | 10           |                   |
      | 10 | Filter      | 6            |                   |
      | 6  | Project     | 5            |                   |
      | 5  | Project     | 12           |                   |
      | 12 | GetVertices | 1            | {"dedup": "true"} |
      | 1  | PassThrough | 0            |                   |
      | 0  | Start       |              |                   |
