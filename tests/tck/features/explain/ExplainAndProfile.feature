Feature: Explain and Profile

  Background:
    Given a graph with space named "nba"

  Scenario Outline: Different format
    When executing query:
      """
      <explain> FORMAT="<format>" YIELD 1
      """
    Then the execution should be successful
    When executing query:
      """
      <explain> FORMAT="<format>" {
        $var=YIELD 1 AS a;
        YIELD $var.*;
      }
      """
    Then the execution should be successful
    When executing query:
      """
      <explain> FORMAT="<format>" {
        YIELD 1 AS a;
      }
      """
    Then the execution should be successful

    Examples:
      | explain | format     |
      | EXPLAIN | row        |
      | EXPLAIN | dot        |
      | EXPLAIN | dot:struct |
      | EXPLAIN | tck        |
      | PROFILE | row        |
      | PROFILE | dot        |
      | PROFILE | dot:struct |
      | PROFILE | tck        |

  Scenario Outline: Error format
    When executing query:
      """
      <explain> FORMAT="unknown" YIELD 1
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at runtime.
    When executing query:
      """
      <explain> FORMAT="unknown" {
        $var=YIELD 1 AS a;
        YIELD $var.*;
      }
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at runtime.
    When executing query:
      """
      <explain> FORMAT="unknown" {
        YIELD 1 AS a;
      }
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at runtime.
    When executing query:
      """
      <explain> EXPLAIN YIELD 1
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at runtime.
    When executing query:
      """
      <explain> PROFILE YIELD 1
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at runtime.

    Examples:
      | explain |
      | EXPLAIN |
      | PROFILE |

  Scenario: Test profiling data format
    When profiling query:
      """
      GO 4 STEPS FROM 'Tim Duncan' OVER like YIELD like._dst AS dst | YIELD count(*)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | count(*) |
      | 6        |
    And the execution plan should be:
      | id | name      | dependencies | profiling data           | operator info |
      | 5  | Aggregate | 4            | {"version":0, "rows": 1} |               |
      | 4  | Project   | 3            | {"version":0, "rows": 6} |               |
      | 3  | ExpandAll | 2            | {"version":0, "rows": 6} |               |
      | 2  | Expand    | 1            |                          |               |
      | 1  | Start     |              |                          |               |
