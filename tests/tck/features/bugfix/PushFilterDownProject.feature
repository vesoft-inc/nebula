Feature: Test push filter down project

  Background:
    Given a graph with space named "nba"

  Scenario: push filter down project
    When profiling query:
      """
      MATCH (n0)-[:like]->(n1)
      WHERE id(n0) IN ['Tim Duncan']
      WITH n1.player.age AS a0
      WHERE (a0 - (a0 + ((a0 % a0) + (a0 + a0)))) <= a0
      RETURN count(*)
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | count(*) |
      | 2        |
    And the execution plan should be:
