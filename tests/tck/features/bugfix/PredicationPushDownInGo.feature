Feature: Test predication push down in go

  Background:
    Given a graph with space named "nba"

  # #4838
  Scenario: predication push down in go
    When profiling query:
      """
      GO FROM "Tim Duncan" OVER like WHERE like._dst NOT IN ["xxx"]
      YIELD like._dst as dst |
      GO FROM $-.dst OVER like REVERSELY WHERE like._dst IN ["Tim Duncan"]
      YIELD like._dst AS dst;
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | dst          |
      | "Tim Duncan" |
      | "Tim Duncan" |
    And the execution plan should be:
      | id | name         | dependencies | operator info                                   |
