Feature: List2 - List Slicing

  Scenario: [1] List slice
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] AS l
      RETURN l[1..3] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r      |
      | [2, 3] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [2] List slice with implicit end
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS l
      RETURN l[1..] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r      |
      | [2, 3] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [3] List slice with implicit start
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS l
      RETURN l[..2] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r      |
      | [1, 2] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [4] List slice with singleton range
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS l
      RETURN l[0..1] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r   |
      | [1] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [5] List slice with empty range
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS l
      RETURN l[0..0] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r  |
      | [] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [6] List slice with negative range
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS l
      RETURN l[-3..-1] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r      |
      | [1, 2] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [7] List slice with invalid range
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS l
      RETURN l[3..1] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r  |
      | [] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: [8] List slice with exceeding range
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS l
      RETURN l[-5..5] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r         |
      | [1, 2, 3] |
    And no side effects

  Scenario Outline: [9] List slice with null range
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS l
      RETURN l[<lower>..<upper>] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r    |
      | null |
    And no side effects

    Examples:
      | lower | upper |
      | null  | null  |
      | 1     | null  |
      | null  | 3     |
      |       | null  |
      | null  |       |

  Scenario: [10] List slice with parameterised range
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | from | 1 |
      | to   | 3 |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS l
      RETURN l[$from..$to] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r      |
      | [2, 3] |
    And no side effects

  @skip
  Scenario: [11] List slice with parameterised invalid range
    Given any graph
    And parameters are:
      | from | 3 |
      | to   | 1 |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS l
      RETURN l[$from..$to] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be, in any order:
      | r  |
      | [] |
    And no side effects
