# What is Nebula Graph?

**Nebula Graph** is an open-source graph database capable of hosting super large scale graphs with dozens of billions of vertices (nodes) and trillions of edges, with milliseconds of latency.

Compared with other graph database solutions, **Nebula Graph** has the following advantages:

* Symmetrically distributed
* Storage and computing separation
* Horizontal scalability
* Strong data consistency by RAFT protocol
* OpenCypher-compatible query language
* Role-based access control for higher level security

## Notice of Release

This repository hosts the source code of Nebula Graph versions before 2.0.0-alpha and after v2.5.x. If you are looking to use the versions between v2.0.0 and v2.5.x, please head to [Nebula Graph repo](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-graph).

Nebula Graph 1.x is not actively maintained. Please move to Nebula Graph 2.x. The data format, rpc protocols, clients, etc. are not compatible between Nebula Graph v1.x and v2.x, but we do offer [upgrade guide](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/2.5.0/4.deployment-and-installation/3.upgrade-nebula-graph/upgrade-nebula-graph-to-250/).
