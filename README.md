# Nebula Graph

**Nebula Graph** is the only solution in the world capable of hosting graphs with dozens of billions of vertices (nodes) and trillions of edges, while still only having milliseconds of latency.

**Nebula Graph's** goal is to provide reading, writing, and computing with high concurrency and low latency for super large scale graphs. **Nebula Graph** is an open source project and we are looking forward to working with the community to popularize and promote the graph database.

As a graph database, **Nebula Graph** has these features:

* Symmetrically distributed
* Highly scalable
* Fault tolerant
* Strong data consistency
* SQL-like query language
* Role-based access control
* Support multiple storage engines

## How Can I Get Nebula Graph

Apart from [installing from source code](docs/manual-EN/3.build-develop-and-administration/1.build/1.build-source-code.md), you can use the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/vesoft/nebula-graph) and [develop](https://hub.docker.com/u/vesoft).

## How to Use Nebula Graph

See [manual](docs/README.md) or download the [pdf](https://nebula-graph.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/doc/manual-en-1204.pdf).

You can also get started by watching [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC73V8q795eSEMxDX4Pvdwmw/).

## How Can I Contribute

As the team behind **Nebula Graph**, we fully commit to the community and all-in to the open source project. All the core features are and will be implemented in the open source repository.
