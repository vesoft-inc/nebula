# What is Nebula Graph?

**Nebula Graph** is an open-source graph database capable of hosting super large scale graphs with dozens of billions of vertices (nodes) and trillions of edges, with milliseconds of latency.

Compared with other graph database solutions, **Nebula Graph** has the following advantages:

* Symmetrically distributed
* Storage and computing separation
* Horizontal scalability
* Strong data consistency by RAFT protocol
* OpenCypher-compatible query language
* Role-based access control for higher level security

## Notice of Release

> **CAUTION**: This is the Nebula Graph 2.0 pre-release. Use it only if you need to test the latest features or performance improvements. DO NOT use it in production.
